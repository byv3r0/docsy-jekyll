# Hello lovely human!


I´m glad you came to visit my site, sometimes I just have too many stuff in my head I wanna share with the wordl but I was so lazy to launch this site.. now that I did it, I hope you find the resources you need to know to be safer online and learn a bit about security stuff that can also help to decrease your digital fingerprint that as you might know, our identity, personal data, interactions and much more sometimes (kinda always) is being studied by big tech companies that take advantege of our data to improve the way algorithms work.

What are these features? You should see the {% include doc.html name="Getting Started" path="getting-started" %}
guide for a complete summary. Briefly:

 - *User interaction* including consistent permalinks, links to ask questions via GitHub issues, and edit the file on GitHub directly.
 - *Search* across posts, documentation, and other site pages, with an ability to exclude from search.
 - *External Search* meaning an ability to link any page tag to trigger an external search.
 - *Documentation* A documentation collection that was easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings for the user, and refer to in markdown.
 - *Pages* A separate folder for more traditional pages (e.g, about).
 - *Navigation*: Control over the main navigation on the left of the page, and automatic generation of table of contents for each page on the right.
 - *News* A posts feed for news and updates, along with an archive (organized by year).
 - *Templates* or specifically, "includes" that make it easy to create an alert, documentation link, or other content.
 - *Continuous Integration* recipes to preview the site
